# Basket pricing using Neural Networks

### Challange:

The client wants to explore novel methodologies for accelerating the pricing of exotic derivatives. 

### Goal: 

The goal is to build a neural network model for [pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/options_beat_market.asp#:~:text=These%20include%20the%20current%20stock,market%20value%20of%20an%20option) European [Basket options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basketoption.asp) under [Black-Scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) assumptions and compare the prices with [Monte-Carlo](https://www.goddardconsulting.ca/option-pricing-monte-carlo-index.html) simulations.

In this project, we are dealing with European basket call.

### Steps:

1. Generate and pricing a Basket options data : [Data_Generating](https://github.com/Merhbene/Basket-pricing-using-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Data_Generating.ipynb).
2. Build, train and compare Neural Network model with Monte carlo simulations [NN_model_for_Basket_Pricing](https://github.com/Merhbene/Basket-pricing-using-Neural-Networks/blob/main/NN_model_for_Basket_Pricing.ipynb)
