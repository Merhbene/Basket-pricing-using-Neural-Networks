# Basket pricing using Neural Networks

### Challange:

The client wants to explore novel methodologies for accelerating the pricing of exotic derivatives. 

### Goal: 

The goal is to build a neural network model for pricing European Basket [options](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/options_beat_market.asp#:~:text=These%20include%20the%20current%20stock,market%20value%20of%20an%20option) under [Black-Scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) assumptions and compare the results with [Monte-Carlo](https://www.goddardconsulting.ca/option-pricing-monte-carlo-index.html) method.

For that, we first simulate the data, build the model, train the model, evaluate the model, compare to Monte carlo model.
